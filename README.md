# Inventory Management System API

### What was this made for
This api was an assignment for my Advanced software engineering class _CS4783_ at UTSA. The professor gave us a .csv file that we had to import into our mysql database hosted on a ec2 free trial instance. The .csv file ended up creating 5,000,000 records in our database. We were given free reign as far as the mysql schema, the structure of our code and just about everything else. I ended up implementing a RESTful API with swagger documentation built upon laravel 8.
